## 2D Platform Game Project
In this game project, our aim was to design the mechanics of a simple 2D platform game. Unity game engine was used in this project, which was designed to be easily expandable.

### Slime System
Slimes are dynamic. If there is an obstacle at ground level where they are placed, they turn back and continue their path. If there is a gap ahead on the path they are walking on, they also turn back and continue their way.
When they come into contact with the player's character, they inflict damage.

### Saw System
There are two types of saws in the game.
One of them is a saw that moves vertically or horizontally and doesn't oscillate. It only goes back and forth between two specific points.
The other one is an oscillating/swinging saw. It swings like it's attached to a chain, moving back and forth between two points.

### Stake System
Stakes are placed in specific positions. They inflict damage to the character when touched in any way.

### Responsive Jump
Jumping is responsive. It allows for jumping to certain heights based on how much Mana is available and how much the jump button is pressed.

### Mana System
Mana decreases based on the character's movements. When there is no movement, the mana bar starts to slowly fill up. (It is customizable.)

### Health System
The character's health is set to 6. When the health reaches 0 due to damage from enemies, the level resets.
